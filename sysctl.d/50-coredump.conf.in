kernel.core_pattern=|@rootlibexecdir@/systemd-coredump %P %u %g %s %t %c %h %e

# Allow that 16 coredumps are dispatched in parallel by the kernel. We want to
# be able to collect process metadata from /proc/%P/ while processing
# coredumps, and thus need to make sure the crashed processes are not reaped
# until we finished collecting what we need. The kernel default for this sysctl
# is "0" which means the kernel doesn't wait for userspace processes to finish
# processing before reaping the crashed processes â€” by setting this higher the
# kernel will delay reaping until we are done, but only for the specified
# number of crashes in parallel. The value of 16 is chosen to match
# systemd-coredump.socket's MaxConnections= value.
